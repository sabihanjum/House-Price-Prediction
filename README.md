# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of rooms, and other property characteristics. By accurately predicting house prices, this project helps provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

## Requirements

Install the following libraries before running the code:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing relationships in the dataset.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Importing Libraries and Dataset
Load the necessary libraries and the housing dataset, which includes various features affecting house prices.

### 2. Data Understanding
Explore the dataset by examining its shape, columns, and any missing values. Visualize key relationships (e.g., price vs. square footage, price vs. number of rooms) to gain insights.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and prepare the dataset by encoding categorical features (like neighborhood) and scaling numerical features.

### 4. Feature Selection and Engineering
Select the most relevant features for predicting house prices. Create new features if necessary, based on existing ones, to enhance model performance.

### 5. Model Building and Evaluation
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then apply machine learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest** to predict house prices. Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared**.

## Conclusion
The **House Price Prediction** model provides reliable estimates of house prices based on relevant features. This can be beneficial for market analysis, pricing strategies, and real estate investment decisions.
